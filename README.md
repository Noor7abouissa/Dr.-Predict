Dr. Predict 🩺

Dr. Predict is a predictive analytics web application designed to help healthcare providers identify patients at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge. The system uses machine learning to generate a personalized risk score based on patient information.

🔍 Project Overview
🎯 Goal: Reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions through early prediction.

💡 Solution: Use ML models trained on patient data to calculate a risk score and provide follow-up recommendations.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS

Backend: Python (Flask)

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (SVM model)

Database: MySQL

Deployment: Docker

Version Control: GitHub

🧠 How It Works
User logs in or registers an account.

Adds new patient data (age, gender, diagnosis, visits, smoking status, etc.).

The system calculates a risk score (1–10) using the ML model.

Dashboard displays risk level and recommended follow-up actions.

Users can view, search, and manage patient records.
